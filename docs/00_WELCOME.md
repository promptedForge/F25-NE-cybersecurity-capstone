# Welcome to Prompted Forge's Capstone

Youâ€™ll work in public, ship iteratively, and prove progress via **objective receipts**.
We value clarity, evidence, and practical security discipline.

**What success looks like:**
- You meet the weekly deliverables.
- Your artifacts are reproducible and auditable.
- You can explain tradeoffs and document them in plain English.

**How receipts work:** update `EvaluationLabels.json` or use `scripts/trigger_objective.sh`.
A workflow writes a timestamped receipt in `receipts/`.
