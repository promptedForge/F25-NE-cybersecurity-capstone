# Smart Contract Tokenization Flow

## Objective → Token → Ledger Pipeline
1. **Objective Clause Satisfied:** Students deliver evidence for O1–O10 and capture proof within the designated artifact.
2. **Token Stub Drafted:** The student steward updates the relevant stub from [`Smart_Contract.md`](./Smart_Contract.md) with `Status=true`, timestamp, and preliminary signatories.
3. **Professor Validation (Epistemic Lock):** Professor confirms evidence, appends signature, and records the state transition.
4. **Sponsor Acknowledgement:** Sponsor adds signature for perception-locked consensus, especially for O10 stretch outputs.
5. **Ledger Update:** `../../../EvaluationLabels.json` flips the objective flag to `true`, mirroring the token state.
6. **Escrow in Ubiquity OS:** Token metadata `{ObjectiveID, Status, Timestamp, Signatories, Anchor}` is escrowed in the Ubiquity OS substrate for non-temporal retrieval.

## Escrow Mechanics
- Tokens remain in escrow until all three consensus roles have signed.
- If a dispute arises, revert the token to `Status=false` and record rationale in commit history referencing the anchor.
- Stretch objectives mint `Stretch_Anchor_O10-XX` tokens allowing multiple advanced contributions without altering core objectives.

## Group Contract as Living Agreement
- Changes to [`Group_Contract.md`](../../../docs/students/Group_Contract.md) generate diffs treated as discrete state capsules.
- Each change references `Contract_Anchor_O7` to maintain the hash chain for auditability.

## Non-Temporal Propagation
- State transitions are recorded without chronological ordering; the anchor references ensure deterministic replay.
- External systems ingesting this repository read tokens, verify anchors, and reconstruct state irrespective of commit timestamps.

Maintain this flow to ensure objective completion equates to grading, preserving transparency and sponsor confidentiality.
