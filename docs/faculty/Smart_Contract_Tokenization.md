# Smart Contract Tokenization Flow

## Objective → Token → Ledger Pipeline
1. **Objective Evidence Completion:** Students deliver evidence for O1–O10 and capture proof within the designated deliverable artifacts.
2. **Token Draft Creation:** The student steward updates the relevant token stub from [`Smart_Contract.md`](./Smart_Contract.md) with `Status=true`, timestamp, and preliminary signatories.
3. **Professor Validation:** Professor confirms evidence meets criteria, appends digital signature, and records the state transition.
4. **Sponsor Acknowledgement:** Sponsor adds signature for consensus validation, particularly for O10 stretch contributions.
5. **Ledger Record Update:** `../../../EvaluationLabels.json` objective flag updates to `true`, mirroring the token state.
6. **Immutable Archive:** Token metadata `{ObjectiveID, Status, Timestamp, Signatories, Anchor}` is permanently recorded for audit and verification.

## Token Management
- Tokens remain in pending state until all three required consensus signatures are obtained.
- If a dispute arises, revert the token to `Status=false` and record rationale in commit history referencing the anchor.
- Stretch objectives generate tokens with `Stretch_Anchor_O10-XX` identifiers, allowing multiple advanced contributions without affecting core objectives.

## Living Contract Integration
- Changes to [`Group_Contract.md`](../../../docs/students/Group_Contract.md) generate tracked diffs treated as discrete state transitions.
- Each contract change references `Contract_Anchor_O7` to maintain the verification chain for auditability.

## State Integrity
- State transitions are recorded based on evidence completion, not chronological ordering; anchor references ensure deterministic verification.
- External systems accessing this repository can read tokens, verify anchors, and reconstruct objective state regardless of commit timestamps.

This tokenization flow ensures objective completion directly correlates with academic evaluation while preserving transparency and maintaining sponsor confidentiality requirements.
